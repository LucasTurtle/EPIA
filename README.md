Text clustering studies

This is a repo for my text clustering assignment in my Artificial Inteligence course at the University of São Paulo.
Implementing tf-idf on the 20newsgroups corpora and then running K-means and Self Organizing Maps algorithms. 

And, of course, visualizing the resulting data using the amazing Plotly library after doing some multidimensional reduction on it! =)
